## Houmovies! üçø
This project is a solution to Houm's coding challenge, where we need to bring data from a public API to the client 

### What I learned in this project

- Fetching data from API with React
- Using environment variables to keep the apy key on secret (Vite / Vercel)
- Managing state on components on Parent/Child relationships
- Multiple ways of rendering data on React
- I built my own React components to learn more while doing this project
- I learned about the Context, Hooks and React lifecycle
