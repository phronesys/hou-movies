## Houmovies! üçø
This project is a solution to Houm's coding challenge, where we need to bring data from a public API showing it on the client 

### What I learned in this project

- Fetching data from API with React
- Using environment variables to keep the apy key on secret (Vite / Vercel)
- Managing state on components on Parent/Child relationships
- Multiple ways of rendering data on React
- I built my own React components to learn more while doing this project

This project should have been submitted 2 days ago, I didn't do it because I was focused on my current job and also because I got confused with the conflicting instructions.
